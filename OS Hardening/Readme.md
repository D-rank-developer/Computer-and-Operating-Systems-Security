## Lab Overview

The operating system (OS) acts as the intermediary between hardware and applications. Its core responsibilities include processing and coordinating input/output (I/O) devices. Processing involves managing and scheduling multiple user programs running simultaneously, as well as defining, managing, and preserving data in memory.

In this lab, I explore OS hardening as a security practice aimed at reducing the system’s attack surface. This is achieved by creating safer environments for applications, removing unnecessary services, and introducing stricter resource control with limited access. The objective of this lab is to examine various OS hardening techniques and understand the rationale behind each step.

### Lab Setup

This workshop focuses on Linux OS hardening techniques. While any Linux distribution can be used, I am using **Ubuntu Server or Ubuntu Desktop 22** for this lab.
