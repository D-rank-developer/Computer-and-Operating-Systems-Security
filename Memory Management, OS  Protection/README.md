# Memory Management, OS Protection & Docker Networking

## Objective

This lab introduces key operating system security concepts and practical containerization techniques. The goal is to understand how modern operating systems manage memory, enforce protection, and achieve isolation using container technologies.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, I was able to:

- Understand operating system memory management concepts and protection mechanisms  
- Explore how operating systems enforce isolation and sandboxing  
- Set up containerized environments using Docker  
- Configure Docker networking to achieve isolation between containers  
- Compare Docker containers with traditional virtual machines  
- Understand how Docker supports sandboxing and isolation within operating systems
