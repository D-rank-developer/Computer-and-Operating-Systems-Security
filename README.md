# Computer Operating Systems Security

Understanding how computers and operating systems function at a deep level is foundational for strong cybersecurity practice. This knowledge helps me:

- Anticipate security threats and work toward effective mitigation  
- Configure operating systems to be hardened, resilient, and more secure  
- Maintain, manage, and track system activities with confidence  
- Control and respond to issues involving user accounts, processes, log files, privileges, firewall configuration, passwords, antivirus solutions, and access controls  

This repository documents my learning journey through core concepts, methodologies, and practical techniques related to computer systems, hardware, and the operating systems that run them. It reflects hands-on exploration and the development of a strong security-focused mindset.

## Learning Objectives

### **LO1**
**Design and implement simple logic circuits** using fundamental logic-design building blocks.

### **LO2**
**Scope, design, synthesise, and optimise virtualised hardware and operating systems** to ensure they are secure by design.

### **LO3**
**Scope, design, and synthesise attacks** that target hardware or operating system vulnerabilities, developing an attacker-aware defensive mindset.

### **LO4**
**Analyse and demonstrate an understanding of system processes and volatile memory**, including how they can be monitored and exploited.

### **LO5**
**Analyse and demonstrate an understanding of persistent storage and filing systems**, and how they influence system security.

### **LO6**
**Scope, design, and synthesise a security solution or strategy** based on a full security review of an operating system.
